Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lisandro Marco Benetti!

Iâ€™m an Italian-Argentinian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· software developer based in the city I fell in love with: Copenhagen ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°.

* Iâ€™ve got an MSc in Software Design from the IT University of Copenhagen.
* Iâ€™m currently working at a Danish start-up as a Data Annotator and Validator, where we use data to train an AI model that automates B2B interactions.
* I love object-oriented programming with Java, but Iâ€™ve also spent a lot of time with Python and really enjoy functional programming too.
* Iâ€™m interested in AI and Data Science, and my Masterâ€™s thesis was fully data-driven. We analyzed the Danish and Italian music industries using network science and cultural data analytics.
* Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lmarcobenetti/).
